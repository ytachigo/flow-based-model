Flow-based deep generative model for molecular conformations
====

Overview
At first, we understand what is normalizing flow in this notebook. 
Second we learn real-valued non-volume preserving (real NVP) which is one of the normalizing flow. 
Most of codes are from E. Jang's web page [1-2]. After that, we will construct the generative model for molecular conformations.
